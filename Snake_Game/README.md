I have created a snake game,
the features are ,
500X500 pixel game display,
snake body made of squares of size 50X50,
and food size 50X50,
the snake changes direction when up, down, left or Right buttons are clicked.
When the snake eats the food its size increases and the Score card at the bottom reflects the increased score.
upon collision of the snake head and body the game aborts.
